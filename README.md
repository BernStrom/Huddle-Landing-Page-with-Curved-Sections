## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

This project was build on purely HTML and CSS.

## Introduction

The Huddle Landing Page with Curved Sections is a project for practicing website layout and responsive desgin in CSS.

It is a new, separate project build on top of the [Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks](https://github.com/BernStrom/Huddle-Landing-Page-with-Alternating-Feature-Blocks/ "Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks") project. This is an alternate version with a different layout design and some additional content added on top of the previous project.

This project was obtained from a list of challenges by Frontend Mentor.

## Objectives of the project

* Use semantic HTML5 markup. *Manage code readability, accessibility and SEO optimization of web page.*

* Style with reusable CSS classes. 

* Use responsive design to make the page compatible on screen across mobile and desktop devices.

* Keep the code as clean as possible.

* Not explicitly required, but hover state features have been added to the buttons and social media icons for extra legitimacy effect. Additionally, focus effects are also added to the input fields of the page.

And don't forget the core of it all, _**Happy coding!ðŸš€**_

_P.S:_ _**Hover state features is not applicable on touchscreen devices, as it is only available through hovering over with a mouse cursor.**_
